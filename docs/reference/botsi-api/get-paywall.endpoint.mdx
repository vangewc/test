{/* Do not edit the metadata */}
Retrieves an AI-predicted paywall configuration for a specific user and placement.

This endpoint triggers the AI Pricing model, which evaluates user context, placement configuration, and historical data to determine
the most relevant paywall to display. The response includes the selected paywall, associated products, and experiment metadata
required for analytics and attribution.

This request must be executed before displaying a paywall to the user. The returned identifiers (`paywallId`, `aiPricingModelId`,
and `isExperiment`) should be reused when sending events and validating purchases.

Identify the user by providing either `customerUserId` or `profileId`. At least one is required to return the correct result.
