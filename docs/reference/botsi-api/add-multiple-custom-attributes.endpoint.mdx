{/* Do not edit the metadata */}
Creates multiple custom attributes for a single profile in one request.

Use this endpoint to set several attributes in bulk for improved performance (for example: tier, subscription_type, referral_source).

Identify the user by providing either `customerUserId` or `profileId`. At least one is required to return the correct result.
