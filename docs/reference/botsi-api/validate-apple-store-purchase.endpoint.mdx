{/* Do not edit the metadata */}
Validates an in-app purchase or subscription completed through the Apple App Store.

Trigger this endpoint after a successful purchase or restore event on the client. The server validates the transaction with Apple
and associates it with the corresponding user profile, paywall, and AI Pricing model for accurate conversion tracking and attribution.

A successful response returns the updated user profile, including subscription and entitlement changes.

Identify the user by providing either `customerUserId` or `profileId`. At least one is required to return the correct result.
