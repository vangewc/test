{/* Do not edit the metadata */}
Records one or more user interaction events related to paywall exposure.

This endpoint is primarily used to track when a paywall is shown to a user (`paywall_shown`). Event data is critical for
AI Pricing analytics, experiment evaluation, and model optimization.

The request body must be an array of event objects. Each event should reference the identifiers returned by the Get Paywall API
to ensure accurate attribution. Call this endpoint immediately after a paywall is displayed to the user.
