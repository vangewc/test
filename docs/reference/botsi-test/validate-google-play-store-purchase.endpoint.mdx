{/* Do not edit the metadata */}
Validates an in-app purchase or subscription completed through the Google Play Store.

This endpoint confirms the purchase token with Google and links the transaction to the user profile and paywall context.
It supports both one-time purchases and subscriptions with multiple pricing phases.

Recommendation:
If you previously called Get Paywall, include `isExperiment` and `aiPricingModelId` from that response to improve analytics attribution.

Identify the user by providing either `customerUserId` or `profileId`. At least one is required to return the correct result.
